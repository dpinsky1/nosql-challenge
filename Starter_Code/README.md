### No-SQL Challenge

-- Many thanks to Saad Khan, Megan Romano, and Martin Bedino for ideas, guidance, and tutoring --

This challenge consisted of two parts.

The first was a setup to change data types and do some basic updating and querying after load in, and the second was querying a database and establishing dataframes in pandas, ultimately creating an aggregation pipeline.
